The error message "sudo: /usr/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set" indicates that the /usr/bin/sudo executable has incorrect ownership or permissions. This prevents sudo from functioning correctly, as it relies on these specific settings to elevate privileges. 
To resolve this issue, perform the following steps, which require a method to gain root privileges without sudo:

Gain Root Access:

If you have the root password: Use su - to switch to the root user.

If you do not have the root password: Restart your system and boot into a recovery mode or single-user mode, which typically grants a root shell. The exact steps vary depending on your operating system and bootloader (e.g., GRUB).
Verify Current Ownership and Permissions:

Once you have root access, use the ls -l command to inspect the current state of /usr/bin/sudo.
 

```
ls -l /usr/bin/sudo
```

The output should ideally resemble -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/bin/sudo. \
Correct Ownership:
Change the owner and group of /usr/bin/sudo to root.
 

```
chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo
```

Set the Setuid Bit: \
Set the setuid bit on /usr/bin/sudo to ensure it executes with root privileges when run by other users.
 

```
chmod u+s /usr/bin/sudo
```

Alternatively, you can use the octal representation: chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo.

Exit Root Session:
After making the changes, exit the root shell or reboot the system if you were in recovery mode.
After completing these steps, sudo should be restored to its proper functionality, allowing you to execute commands with elevated privileges as intended.
